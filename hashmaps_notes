based off of arrays 
hashmap is created from a hash function and maps the val onto a key 
a key in a hashmap is immutable 
France: Paris
Pakistan : Islamabad 
Japan  : Tokyo 

Hash function
France = index 0 
Pakistan = index 1 
Japan = index 2

doesnt need to go through every element on the list 
hashmaps are called dictionaries in python 
first initialize the hashmap 
city_map = {}
city+map = dict()


to add key value pairs

first initialize the key 
cities = ["Calgary", "Vancouver", "Toronto"]
city_map["Canada"]= []
city_map["Canada"] += cities

##result will look like {‘Canada’: [‘Calgary’, ‘Vancouver’, ‘Toronto’]}

To avoid having to initialize keys, use defaultDict, will save you time and energy 
from collections import defaultdict 
city_map = defaultdict(list)
cities = ["Calgary", "Vancouver", "Toronto"]
city_map["Canada"] += cities
